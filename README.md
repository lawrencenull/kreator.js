## About

GUI Editor for reveal.js
https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/31

If you are too lazy to clone and check it out yourself there is a youtube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdeq1PJh14s a little old but it gives a general idea

There is an about page https://github.com/piatra/kreator.js/wiki/About

## Features

Please submit features bugs and request I'm very interested in what people expect from such an editor.
Currently you can create slides and add text which you can edit inline (you can align it, add anchor tags, make headings and such).
There is no option to download the presentation yet.

## Progress

I update the project once a day so it's evolving fast.
There is a feature list and I'm using github issues to keep track of them. Hope to cross off as many as possible

- Create your slides in any direction you like and edit the content inline. No more HTML formatting and tweaking, you concentrate on the content and Kreator will do the rest
- Custom fonts from Google Fonts for an extra touch of good looks
- Saving your presentation in the form of a gist for safekeeping
- Importing existing reveal.js presentations. You just found out about Kreator ? Bring your existing presentations in for a tweak.
- Easy image manipulation, drag and drop, resize, grid alignment
- Download link for your presentation for any advanced tweeks that the application might not be prepared
