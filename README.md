## About

GUI Editor for reveal.js
https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/31

If you are too lazy to clone and check it out yourself there is a youtube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdeq1PJh14s a little old but it gives a general idea

There is an about page https://github.com/piatra/kreator.js/wiki/About

## Features

Please submit features bugs and request I'm very interested in what people want from this project

## Progress

Currently this is just a proof of concept. Some editing is available. Adding slides, text and minimal formatting.
In the end the slides will be saved as github gists and you will be able to download them as a zip archive
